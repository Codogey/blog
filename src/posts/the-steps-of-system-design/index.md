## Step 1: Requirements clarifications

TODO: common ask questions?
- Are we focusing on the backend only or are we developing the front-end too?
- we should clarify what parts of the system we will be focusing on.

Functional/Non-functional requirements

## Step 2: System interface definition

## Step 3: Back-of-envelope estimation
what to care? traffic, QPS, storage, netword bandwidth. How thess things affect our decisions?

## Step 4: Defining data model
SQL vs NoSQL

## Step 5: High-level design
what to consider? number of read vs write

# Step 6: detailed design
provide different approaches, pros and cons. why we will prefer one approach.

## Step 7: identifying and resolving bottlenecks
- single point of failure.
- monitoring the performance?
